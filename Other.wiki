= Other notes =

* Scientific cookie cutter scientific projects
* pyMC3 - probabilistic programming. useful for Bayesian distributions and
  statistical inference. http://github.com/pymyc-devs/pymc3
* xarray - "numpy with labels", or "N-dimensional dataframes"
* Altair viz library. Has interacitve filtering that will change other plots.
  Less flashy then other viz libraries
* Plotly - viz library wrapper on top of d3. plotly.js lets you create JS
  graphs. plotly.py is full python.
  * Dash is a flask-based, react-front-end for creating dashboards. Could
    feasibly put gunicorn in front to spin up your own dashboards.
    
* Pandas birds-of-a-feather: Pandas 0.24 to start deprecating stuff in prep
for 1.0. 
  * Panels
  * .ix indexing
  * something else I forgot

* 0.25 to 1.0 should be pretty seamless. 0.24 will have all the deprecation
  warnings
